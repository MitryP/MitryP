Hi there, my name is Dmytro. I'm from Ukrane and I'm a Software Engineering student at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. 
Photography, music and learning natural languages are also among my interests.

Currently, I'm practicing Dart ðŸ”¥ in pair with Flutter and Angel Server Framework and working on my own project, [Balanced App](https://balanced.com.ua) while publishing some [open-source Dart libraries](https://pub.dev/publishers/mitryp.com.ua). The source code of most of my projects can be found here, on my GitHub.
