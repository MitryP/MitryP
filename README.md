Hi there, my name is Dmytro. I'm from Ukrane and I'm a Software Engineering student at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. 
Photography, music and learning natural languages are also among my interests.

Currently, I'm practicing Dart ðŸ”¥ in pair with Flutter and Angel Server Framework and working on my own project, [Balanced App](https://balanced.com.ua), while maintaining some [open-source Dart libraries](https://pub.dev/publishers/mitryp.com.ua). The source code of most of my projects can be found here, on my GitHub.

In my free time, I'm working on the tutorial video series about Design Patterns in the Ukrainian language.

Here you can take a look on my older packages on Python: [PyPi](https://pypi.org/user/MitryP/).

Finally, here you can find my implementations of some algorithms from Algs4 Princeton University course in Java: [Matrix Percolation](https://github.com/mitryp/Algs4MatrixPercolation), [Pattern Matching](https://github.com/mitryp/Algs4PatternMatching), [Collision System](https://github.com/mitryp/Algs4CollisionSystem).
